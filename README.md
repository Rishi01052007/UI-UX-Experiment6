# UI-UX-Experiment6

## Aim:

To practice solution ideation, user story creation, scenario development, flow mapping, and information architecture design to improve user experience through structured UX design activities.

## Algorithm:

Solution Ideation: Use a known UX problem (e.g., booking an appointment in a hospital app). Task: Conduct crazy 8s or brainwriting ideation exercise. Generate multiple low-fidelity ideas.

Creating User Stories: Use personas and their goals to write user stories. Task: Write at least 5 user stories using this format: As a [user], I want to [goal], so that [benefit].

Creating Scenarios: Select a user story. Task: Create a narrative scenario that describes the user in context. Include emotional states, tasks, and environment.

Flow Diagrams / Flow Mapping: Choose a task (e.g., ordering food via app). Task: Draw a task flow diagram or user flow. Use standard symbols (start, decision, action, etc.).

Information Architecture (IA): Take an example website or app (e.g., university site, news portal). Task: Perform card sorting (open or closed). Create a site map showing categorized structure.


## Output:
1. Solution Ideation
Known UX Problem:

Patients find it confusing and time-consuming to book an appointment with doctors using hospital apps. They face issues like unclear doctor availability, long loading times, and complicated booking steps.

Crazy 8’s Ideation Exercise (8 Quick Ideas):
```
Idea	Description
1	One-click doctor booking button on the home screen.
2	Voice search option to find doctors by specialization (e.g., “Cardiologist near me”).
3	Smart calendar showing available slots in real time.
4	Filter doctors by experience, fees, and ratings.
5	Chatbot assistant to help users navigate or book quickly.
6	Notification reminder for upcoming appointments.
7	Option to reschedule or cancel appointments easily.
8	Integration with health insurance for instant verification.
```

Low-Fidelity Idea Sketch (Concept Summary):

A simple home screen with:

“Book Appointment” button

Search bar (“Find Doctor or Specialty”)

Calendar with available time slots

Confirmation pop-up with “Add to Reminder” option

2. Creating User Stories

Based on personas (patients and doctors):

As a patient, I want to search for doctors by specialization, so that I can find the right expert quickly.

As a patient, I want to view available appointment slots, so that I can book at a convenient time.

As a patient, I want to get reminders for my upcoming appointments, so that I don’t miss them.

As a doctor, I want to update my availability schedule, so that patients can see real-time slots.

As a patient, I want to reschedule my appointment easily, so that I can adjust in case of emergencies.

3. Creating Scenarios
Selected User Story:

As a patient, I want to view available appointment slots so that I can book at a convenient time.

Scenario Narrative:

User: Priya Sharma, a 21-year-old college student, feels sudden tooth pain and wants to book a dentist appointment.

Context:
She’s in her college library using her phone during a short break. She opens the hospital app to find a nearby dentist.

Tasks & Steps:

Opens the app → clicks “Book Appointment”

Types “Dentist” in the search bar

Views a list of available doctors with ratings and fees

Selects “Dr. Meena Rao” and checks the calendar

Picks an available slot for 4:00 PM the next day

Confirms the appointment

Emotional State:

Before booking: Worried and in slight pain

During booking: Relieved that the app is easy to use

After booking: Calm and satisfied after receiving confirmation and reminder

4. Flow Diagram / Flow Mapping
Task: Booking a doctor appointment via hospital app

Flow Diagram (Text Description):
```
[Start]

   ↓
[Open App]

   ↓
[Login / Sign Up]

   ↓
[Search for Doctor]

   ↓
[Select Specialization]

     ↓
[List of Doctors]

     ↓
[Choose Doctor → View Profile]

[Check Available Slots]
   ↓
[Select Date & Time]
   ↓
[Confirm Appointment]
   ↓
[Payment (Optional)]
   ↓
[Receive Confirmation & Reminder]
   ↓
[End]

```
Decision Points:

If doctor unavailable → choose another doctor

If slot full → pick next available date

5. Information Architecture (IA)
Example App: Hospital Appointment Booking App

Card Sorting:
(Closed card sorting — categories defined by the design team)

Category	Possible Cards/Items
Home	Quick Book, Featured Doctors, Health Tips
Doctors	Specializations, Ratings, Experience, Availability
Appointments	Upcoming, Past, Reschedule, Cancel
Payments	Bills, Insurance, Transaction History
Profile	Personal Info, Medical History, Settings
Site Map (Hierarchical Structure):
```
Home
 ├── Quick Book
 ├── Featured Doctors
 └── Health Articles

Doctors
 ├── Search by Specialization
 ├── Top Rated
 └── Nearby Doctors

Appointments
 ├── Upcoming Appointments
 ├── Past Appointments

## Result:

To practice solution ideation, user story creation, scenario development, flow mapping, and information architecture design to improve user experience through structured UX design activities is done successfully.
